-introduction-
uhh so i dont know how to make a new text document in this thing so this will have
to do for now. yahoo im wasting more time by writing more yap. oh also i made a
new title card inspired by sonic games. cool. i forgot to git ps both of my repos
so i cant do work class work today without giving me the merge nightmare, or i
guess the mergemare? so im just experimenting around with bluej so i can learn it.

-i hate bluej-
oh boy. i hate it. i think i wrote this in my processing stuff but i need to
reiterate this here. i. hate. bluej. it is a hassle to get to even run at all, it
is a hassle to learn how to use it, it is a hassle to get help, its just so hard
for seemingly no reason. why.
